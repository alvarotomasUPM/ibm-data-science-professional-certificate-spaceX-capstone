In this capstone project course I have adquired the knowledge of what data scientists have to go through in real life when working with real data sets. 

I have taken on the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup that intends to compete with SpaceX and in the process follow a Data Science approach in regards to data collection, data discussion, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation and reporting the results taken for stakeholders.
